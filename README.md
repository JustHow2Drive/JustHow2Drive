# Hello, Iâ€™m JustHow2Drive

I am a dedicated high school developer specializing in backend and full-stack development. Proficient in a wide range of programming languages including Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Java, Bash, C++, and Rust, I build scalable and efficient applications using frameworks such as Django, Flask, FastAPI, React, Node.js, Express, and Vue.
My expertise extends to cybersecurity, where I actively participate in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions and penetration testing, strengthening my knowledge in information security.
I have practical experience with cloud platforms like AWS and VPS, as well as containerization and orchestration tools such as Docker and Kubernetes. Additionally, I work with infrastructure-as-code using Terraform, and manage databases including MongoDB, Redis, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Elasticsearch.
Beyond software development, I have a strong interest in hardware, including PC building and microcontroller programming with Arduino and Raspberry Pi. I prioritize effective planning, time management, and a systematic approach to problem-solving.
I am committed to continuous learning, exploring fields such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and blockchain technology. I actively contribute to open-source projects and engage with the developer community through workshops, meetups, and educational content.
I welcome collaboration opportunities and enjoy sharing knowledge with others to contribute to impactful projects.
